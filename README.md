## Description

This Plugin adds a Color Picker Field type in either HEX or RGB format to the Advanced Fields in Formidable Pro and is intended to allow users pick colors for entries in a text field. A workaround on the [Formidable Web Site](https://formidablepro.com/adding-a-color-picker-field/) allows for easier deployment through this plugin with the inclusion of [jscolor](http://jscolor.com/).

**Please Note:** *This plugin requires the Formidable Pro Plugin (https://formidablepro.com/) by [Strategy11 ](http://strategy11.com/)to be installed and activated before installation.*

## Installation

1. Upload `formidable-color-picker.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip it there, or use the WordPress Dashboard to install it.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create your forms as usual and use either the Color Picker (HEX) or Color Picker (RGB) Field type in the Advanced Fields section to add Color Picker Fields

## FAQ

**Why would I want a color picker?**

1. You may wish to give users the option of selecting colors. For instance, when creating a recurring entry in a calendar, you might want the user to be able to select a color for their entry so it's easy to see among others.

1. Any time you want users to be able to select colors for elements, use a color picker field, and then insert the value of that field as a style attribute or an inline style in a view. You could even create a view that's nothing but a style sheet with dynamic values from your form. 

1. The possibilities are endless.

**Why is this so simple?**

It fixes a simple problem.

**Can I have more than one Color Picker Field in a Form?**

Yes!

**What about more display options?**

As needed or requested
